/** \brief A OGRE3DBodyDescription is basically a RigidBodyDescription containg all the
           physics data collision model and global pose of an RigidBody; but now with some data
           that describes how the rigid body looks on the screen. Using a extension of a RigidBody
           is one way of doing this, in some cases your implementation of NxOgre may require
           something more specific or different, either way - you will need a RigidBodyDescription.
           It's just how much you use it is important.
    \example
      <code>
        OGRE3DRigidBodyDescription description;
        description.mMass = 100.0f; 
        description.mMeshName = "ogrehead.mesh";
        
        OGRE3DBody* body = mOgreRenderSystem->createBody(..., description);
      </code>
