/** \brief A OGRE3DKinematicBody is just an Actor that is "rendered" on the screen. Not only containing
           the standard physics properties and functions of an Actor. It also contains some
           information describing the object visually; what shape it is, it's dimensions and
           it's colour. Once combined that with the getPose() function from Actor. It's pretty
           easy to use all of that information to draw something on the screen. Of course in
           different types of RenderSystems available; the render information would be different.
           Ogre's for example wouldn't be as low-level, and would only contain a pointer to a node
           on a scenegraph, as well as reference to the mesh it is using.
