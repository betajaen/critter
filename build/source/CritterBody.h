/*! class. Body
    desc.
        A Body is just an Actor that is "rendered" on the screen. Not only containing
        the standard physics properties and functions of an Actor. It also contains some
        information describing the object visually; what shape it is, it's dimensions and
        it's colour. Once combined that with the getPose() function from Actor. It's pretty
        easy to use all of that information to draw something on the screen. Of course in
        different types of RenderSystems available; the render information would be different.
        Ogre's for example wouldn't be as low-level, and would only contain a pointer to a node
        on a scenegraph, as well as reference to the mesh it is using.
